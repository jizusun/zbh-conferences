The International Forum of Artificial Intelligence and STEM Education (IFAISE2020, Online conference) will be held on **December 26th, 2020**. This forum is funded by the Education Foundation of Wang Kuancheng, supported by the Ministry of Education in China. It will be hosted by the School of Education, Shaanxi Normal University, Xi’an, China. Shaanxi Normal University is one of the six normal universities that are directly affiliated to the Ministry of Education in China, and Xi’an is a famous historical city, which is the starting point of the ancient “silk road”, and where people can see the terracotta warriors and horses. The conference is co-organized by Shaanxi Normal University (http://english.snnu.edu.cn ), and Science Popularization and Education Research Support Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences (http://www.casisd.cn/ ). We hope IFAISE 2020 (Xi’an) can be a good platform for international science education scholars to share their ideas, experiences, strategies to address opportunities, challenges, especially solutions for science education, Artificial intelligence-enabled Education and STEM education. As for technology-supported science education, the presented study raises more questions than it provides answers.

We sincerely invite you to attend IFAISE2020, and bring new ideas, new study results, and new perspectives to promote science and technology education in China and worldwide.


## 1. The Conference Theme

**The resurgence of artificial intelligence (AI) and the development of STEM education**

Artificial intelligence (AI) integrates a series of advanced technologies, and brings new possibilities for sustainable development and social change, thus making a profound impact on education. In China, STEM education has initially entered the field of national policy in 2015, at that time, the Ministry of Education issued the *Guiding Opinions on Comprehensively and Deeply Promoting Educational Informatization During the 13th Five-Year Plan Period (Draft for Solicitation of Comments)* which clearly stated:

> "Explore new education models such as STEAM education and maker education".

As in some places in other parts of the world, STEM has raised the interests of science and technology educators in China. Significant progress has been made in educational practice, theoretical research and the educational policy of STEM education. However, we are still facing many challenges in the practice of STEM education, especially when we can apply many AI technologies in education. Therefore, this international forum aims to enhance international collaboration and discuss the development, problems and challenges in science and technology education, STEM education, and Artificial intelligence-enabled education.
